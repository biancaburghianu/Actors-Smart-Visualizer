                            <b>The main poster features Margot Robbie as Barbie calls her 'everything'.</b>

                            There are other character posters for Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Nicola Coughlan, Hari Nef,

                            do, the Kens are hilariously 'just Ken'.
                            <br></br>Other new characters include Emerald Fennell as Midge and Michael Cera as Allan.
                            America Ferrara, Ariana Greenblatt, Will Ferrell, Connor Swindells, and Jamie Demetriou play
                            the humans while Helen Mirren is the narrator. The tone of the posters is quirky and fun,
                            feeling like the audience is also in a joke with the characters.</span>

                    <p>Lady Gaga was spotted shooting for her upcoming film Joker: Folie À Deux in a key location at New
                        York City that was made famous by Joaquin Phoenix's titular character from Joker (2019). Gaga,
                        who plays Harley Quinn in the sequel to the 2019 blockbuster, was spotted at the iconic stairs

                            paparazzo, which were shared on Twitter. showed Lady Gaga in an oversized black coat and
                            gloves as she walked down the staircase connecting Shakespeare and Anderson avenues at West
                            167th Street in the Bronx. In another picture, she appeared to be discussing the scene in
                            detail with her director Todd Philips. This location was made famous after the 2019 film
                            Joker, where Joaquin Phoenix was seen dancing his way down the graffiti-laced stairs in
                            character. Phoenix went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in
                            the film.
                            <br></br>Last week, several pictures and videos clicked by the paparazzo went viral after
                            Lady Gaga was spotted in her Harley Quinn statement outfit, which included a red jacket, a
                            checkered top and a black skirt paired with mesh black leggings. She was spotted shooting
                            for some scenes at Manhattan's City Hall. The set for the film also saw a dozen extra
                            characters who were spotted standing on the stairs of the building during the shoot. Some
                            were even dressed as cops.


                            <br></br>
                            The first look from the movie was unveiled two months ago on the occasion of Valentine's
                            Day. Todd Philips took to Instagram and surprised fans with the first look of the film and
                            wrote in the caption, "Happy Valentine's Day." Lady Gaga also shared the same picture on her
                            account and wrote it: “Folie à Deux." The image showed a close-up of a shocked Lady Gaga as
                            Harley Quinn holding the face of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker in her cusp of her palms, whereas
                            the Joker put a signature knowing smile. The film is eyeing a release on October 24, 2024.

                        DC Comics' lesser-known hero Blue Beetle finally gets his own
                        movie, promising a family-friendly treat with a comedic tone and a
                        diverse cast.In the comics, Blue Beetle has had several
                        iterations. But in the film, we are introduced to Jaime Reyes, the
                        third character to take on the mantle of the Blue Beetle. (DC)
                        <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4" style="display:none;">The superhero genre has been
                            booming for years, and
                            it's no
                            secret that Marvel has dominated the big screen with its
                            blockbusters. But DC Comics has its own rich collection of
                            heroes and villains, and it's about time that one of its
                            lesser-known characters gets his due. Enter Blue Beetle, the
                            B-list crusader that has finally landed his first feature film
                            adaptation with Warner Bros. The debut of the film's first
                            trailer is a brilliant burst of cobalt-coloured light that
                            promises to deliver a family-friendly summertime treat.<br></br>

                            In the comics, Blue Beetle has had several iterations. But in
                            the film, we are introduced to Jaime Reyes, the third character
                            to take on the mantle of the Blue Beetle. Reyes is a teenager
                            from El Paso, Texas, who bonds with an ancient alien scarab that
                            gives him his surging azure-tinted superpowers. This transforms
                            Reyes into an ominous insectoid avenger clad in alien armour,
                            allowing sustained flight and blasting bolts of coherent energy
                            from appendages.<br></br><b>A landmark moment for Latin representation in

                            superhero. And with the film slated to be a vital component of
                            the upcoming cinematic universe, the inclusion of this hero is a
                            welcome step in the right direction.<br></br> <b>The star-studded cast of
